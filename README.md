## ðŸš€ Key Features

You can check the development progress of the following features through [PoleStar Chat - Public Roadmap](https://statuesque-goal-eef.notion.site/PoleStar-Chat-Public-Roadmap-d4d9a483564f409ba16ff22792c806f9?pvs=4) , and we welcome feedback in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/esyCEGhmq9).

**IM App Design:**
To make the product more approachable, the product's design adopts IM interaction. You can create a chat room (Channel) and talk directly to the AI assistant through the input box like using other IM products. Also, to solve the problem of difficulty in calling prompt templates, you can quickly call prompts through the AT method, like this:

**Support for multiple models:**
Currently available tools have two main issues: difficulty in calling prompts and support for only single models or LLM models. To lower the threshold for model usage, we will support the use of multiple models in the future, such as text-to-image models or open-source models in vertical fields. In the next version, you will be able to use AT Text2Image Bot in the IM to generate images from text using AI.

**Pay-as-you-go mode:**
The last and perhaps most significant obstacle for users is the price. OpenAI membership costs $20 per month, Midjourney costs $30 per month, but for individual use, it may not be feasible to use them at full capacity, and the $50 monthly fee is still expensive for many people. To solve this problem, we will support paying for Tokens and pay-as-you-go model calls in the future. Simply put, you pay for what you use, reducing usage costs.

**Support for custom data sources:**
In addition to supporting multiple models, we also plan to support custom data sources. This means that in the future, you can use our tool to build your own knowledge base AI Bot.

**Open-source code:**
As the saying goes, many hands make light work. We know that individual efforts are not enough to get more people to use AI, so we decided to introduce the power of the open-source community. We expect to open-source our code (excluding server-side code) around July, and everyone can use our product for secondary development.
